                  We have had some customers who mistakenly believe they have a store
                account when in fact they are only signed up to receive our VIP club newsletter.

                If you receive our newsletter but have never made a purchase online this might
                apply to you, the best way to check this is to do the following:
                </p>
                <p>1. Go back to the <a href="#">register page</a></p>
                <p>2. Register with your email address</p>
                <p>if you do already have an account the form will tell you</p>

                <p>If the form tells you you already have an account 
                  and the password reset doesn't work, please contact the 
                  Customer Service Team on 033 900 0094
                </p>
